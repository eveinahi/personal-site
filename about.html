                Gaming has been a big part of my life since I was a child. Growing up playing fps games, story-mode games, falling in love with characters that I felt connected to. It's another world, different experiences, different outcomes.

               I have always been a very sensitive person when it comes to music, I love the sounds, the flows from one ear to another, different beats, unique sounds that artists come up with. It inspired me to make my own, to learn the different frequencies that I can create.
